## Install

### Crate

```
cargo install canvas-cli
```

### Single Static Binary

Download from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mbund/canvas-cli/releases/latest).

### Nix

As a [Nix](https://nixos.org) flake:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    canvas-cli.url = "github:mbund/canvas-cli";
  };
}
```

```nix
{
  pkgs,
  canvas-cli,
  ...
}: {
  # home-manager
  home.packages = with pkgs; [
    # ...
    canvas-cli.packages.x86_64-linux.default
  ];

  # nixos
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    # ...
    canvas-cli.packages.x86_64-linux.default
  ];
}
```

Or run it directly with `nix run github:mbund/canvas-cli auth`.

## Authenticate

Run `canvas-cli auth` and follow the prompts. In total, you will:

Go to your user profile settings at `https://YOUR_INSTITUTION.instructure.com/profile/settings` or through the UI. Go to **Approved Integrations** and click on **+ New Access Token**.

![](./docs/new-access-token.png)

Then, give your access token a reasonable name like `canvas-cli` and click **Generate Token**. You can leave the **Expiration date** and **Expiration time** blank for it to never expire, or to whatever date you feel is reasonable. Note that access tokens can be revoked at any time you want to later.

![](./docs/new-access-token-dialog.png)

Finally, copy this `Token` field and paste it into `canvas-cli auth` when it asks. You can now close out of the dialog.

![Access Token Details dialog with ](./docs/access-token-details.png)

```
$ canvas-cli auth
> Canvas Instance URL: https://osu.instructure.com
> Access token: ********

```

## Submit assignments

![canvas-cli submit --help](./docs/submit-help.gif)

Submit interactively, selecting the course and assignment from a dropdown.

![canvas-cli submit upload-test.pdf](./docs/submit.gif)

Or submit programmatically, specifying the Course ID and Assignment ID as arguments. These IDs are in the URL of the assignment on your Canvas instance.

![canvas-cli submit -c 162316 -a 3936973 upload-test-1.pdf](./docs/submit-ids.gif)

Or just pass the URL to parse it.

![canvas-cli submit -u https://osu.instructure.com/courses/183022/assignments/4598164 upload-test-1.pdf](./docs/submit-url.gif)

## Download files

Download one or more files from a course. Note that the list is like the **Files** tab on the course page, rather than any linked files under an Assignment.
